# Workflow Recommender
This research aims to create the blueprint for a localisation workflow recommender. In order to carry this out it will be necessary to find out the tasks involved in the localisation workflow (from content preparation to delivery), the workflow patterns necessary to enact the workflows (from simple sequence to the dynamic partial join for multiple instances), the optimal language to describe them (BPEL, YAWL, jPDLâ€¦) and what is out there (from traditional translation workflows to community driven projects). With all this information on board, the system will analyse a localisation project and generate an adequate workflow.
